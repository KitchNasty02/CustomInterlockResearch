
# Research Project
Investigating custom interlock patterns to enhance mechanical strength and reduce anisotropy.

# Implementation
 - Split the input STL file in half
 - Dynamically create an interlock pattern
 - Add/Subtract pattern from left and right path
 - Export two new STL files with interlocks
 - Upload STL files to PrusaSlicer and slice
